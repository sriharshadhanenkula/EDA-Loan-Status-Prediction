# EDA-Loan-Status-Prediction


Project related to Machine Learning

Project Description:
In India,the number of people applying for the loans gets increased for various reasons in recent years. The bank employees are not able to analyse or predict whether the customer can payback the amount or not (good customer or bad customer) for the given interest rate. The aim of this paper is to find the nature of the client applying for the personal loan. An exploratory data analysis technique is used to deal with this problem.

The result of the analysis shows that short term loans are preferred by majority of the clients and the clients majorly apply loans for debt consolidation. The results are shown in graphs that helps the bankers to understand the clientâ€™s behavior.
